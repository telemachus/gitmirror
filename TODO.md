# TODO

+ Clean up codebase overall (more abstraction? clearer flow?).
+ Clean up recent addition of display code (is everything in the right file or
  place? is there duplication?).
+ Consider errors and output. In the first version of the new output code,
  errors are never shown. How and when should they be shown?
