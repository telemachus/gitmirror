## Clean up

This works now as a single command, but thereâ€™s a lot of overlapping 
responsibilities and cruft.

+ How should I handle the command and subcommand names? (Store them in the app? 
  Store them as package constants? Something else?)
+ What is the responsibility of the app versus just a function call?
+ Maybe I can handle flags and flag-parsing better?
